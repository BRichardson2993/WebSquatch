				<p class="introParagraph">Brian began designing as a necessity when he started his own screen printing company in 2001. His wife, Anne, is a wonderful graphic designer, having worked in print and web for well over 20 years.
					<br> <span class="spec">&lpar;see her work here: <a href="http://www.speccreative.com" target="_blank">Spec Creative</a>&rpar;</span>. Brian eventually began working with Anne on her client projects which inspired him to learn more about web development.</p>

				<p class="introParagraph">After going to school to learn UI/UX design and development, Brian landed his first web development job in the art department at Hobby Lobby. This position eventually transitioned Brian into Full Stack development, focusing much more on the back end.
